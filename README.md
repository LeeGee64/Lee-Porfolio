# Lee-Portfolio

A simple yet comprehensive display of my coding projects with links to websites and app deployments.  


## The Process

I decided to limit the tech stack to simple HTML and CSS in order to keep my portfolio lightweight and easy to update with future projects. My hope is that the single page project will be informative and convey my minimalist approach to programming. The portfolio is hosted on Netflify for update simplicity and eventual form handling.


## Optimization


* *Additional Projects:* As I complete commissioned websites/apps along with personal projects, I'll be adding them to their respective sections on the page. My current goal is to master Next.Js/React through building several different types of applications. 

**Note:** Some projects of mine were platformed for free on Heroku (which recently ended free hosting) so they will be unavailable until I better hosting solution. 


* *Intake Forms:* With each project I complete, my skillset grows along with the services I can provide to customers and companies alike. Right now, I just have my contact information at the bottom of the page for any business/collaboration inquiries. Through Netlify's form handling service, I will be able to generate an intake form where interested parties can detail their needs.
